#  2024 Summer KAPS Methods Workshop: Text-as-Data

![](https://github.com/taegyoon-kim/24summer_text/blob/main/kaps_summer_workshop.jpg)


## Time and location

- Time: 9:30-12:00pm (Session I) & 2:00-4:30pm (Session II), July 11 
- Location: 61907 Suseongwan, SKKU (성균관대 수선관 61907)


## Overview

This workshop, titled "Text-as-Data" (or "텍스트 분석"), introduces social science students to a key subset of essential concepts and techniques in text-as-data. The emphasis is on developing critical insights for applied research. The workshop will blend theoretical understanding with practical, hands-on experience. The workshop consists of two sessions (2.5 hours each). The first session will start with text pre-processing and representation and will offer an overview of supervised approaches for classification and scaling. The second session will focus on unsupervised methods in text-as-data, including word embeddings and topic models.


## Readings

A list of readings, including both textbooks and articles, is provided below. Note that, while these readings are **not mandatory** (particularly given the short timeline and introductory nature of the workshop), students are encouraged to engage with them. The lectures are designed to be **largely comprehensible without prior reading**, but the materials will greatly enhance understanding of the concepts, techniques, and related applications.

We will not adhere strictly to any single textbook but rely on some sections of each of the two books in below. The e-book version of [GRS] is available for purchase ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Data-Framework-Learning-Sciences/dp/0691207550/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CPKNTC00QCVS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZqhNbSSUo7xXxJN96D49HOb-LsPfVUYeqymFmdFMl6MI248SPyaKcfueeNgIfGZx81-VahRpih48RmOugkLlcust2J2UlhsRrd-XY5GCFNpU8kALzl1Aau9vdteFCQ5tQGTM5tOKnfjp41vI7KHg64EoLk9SNsyIAIAD1LriQStgEXyipMHYR2B8YpdN129PL2ik4LbGB6kUoeTXEZM5XNHOC1hYQAMrmpKddTHFqBg.TI0XEooYQTfDwcU-12YE9KJaJ9Kp1-Z4LVYGBI0knNA&dib_tag=se&keywords=text-as-data&qid=1720359650&sprefix=text-as-da%2Caps%2C264&sr=8-1)).

## Tutorials

The workshop will invovle guided coding (or tutorials) using Python. Little prior experience in the language is assumed. Note that students are expected to bring their own computing device.
